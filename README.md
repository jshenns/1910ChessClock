# 1910ChessClock
Chess clock software for EENG 1910 final project. 

In order to develop this system, I started with a proof of concept chess clock program in C++ that ran in the console. I used this program to propose the project to my
professor. When it was approved, I designed a simple hardware interface with the Arduino. The program was then redeveloped using C and the Arduino IDE with the same
concepts as the orginal console program.
