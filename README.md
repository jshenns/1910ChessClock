# 1910ChessClock
Chess clock software for EENG 1910 final project.
This is a bit of software that I decided to write for my Intro to Electrical Engineering Class. We were tasked with creating a final project, which consisted of building some
circuit that 'solved a problem'. Since my circuit game is not as strong as my software game at the moment, I decided to go with a more software intensive solution. Sure we could 
have used logic gates and designed out an entire system like that, but I didn't want to. So instead, I wrote a chess clock in C++ that I could run in the command line of my laptop
with the intention of modifying the code for arduino, and then using a couple of buttons, and an lcd screen to accomplish the project. The program itsself is a chess clock because
I like to play chess, and it seemed like something fun that could get us a good grade.
